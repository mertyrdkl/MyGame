# MyGame
Welcome to my first-ever multiplayer number guessing game. Are you a fan of Poker? If so, you might find this game intriguing as well.

# Philosophy 
In life, our choices aren't the only factors that shape our destiny. We're also influenced by actions beyond our control - especially those of others. Perhaps, what truly leads to success is our ability to interpret the signs around us and respond appropriately. This game encapsulates that philosophy. The best strategy isn't just about making good choices, but also about understanding and predicting your opponent's moves.

# About the Game

This game is a fun challenge of strategy and chance that allows multiple players to compete against each other. Each player selects a secret number within a given range. The objective of the game is to guess the sum of all players' secret numbers. The player whose guess is closest to the actual sum is declared the winner of the round. The game continues for a user-specified number of rounds, and the player with the highest total score at the end is declared the overall winner.

# Concept

This game captures the essence of decision making in uncertain situations. While it may seem simple at first glance, it requires careful observation and strategic thinking. The best action relies on how well you read your opponents' choices. It's not just about the numbers you choose, but how those numbers relate to the choices of others.

# How to Run

To start the game, simply run the Python file named myGame.py (or whatever your python file is called). You will be prompted to enter the number of players and rounds. Enjoy!
